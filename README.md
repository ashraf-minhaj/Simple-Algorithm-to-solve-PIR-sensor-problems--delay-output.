# Simple-Algorithm-to-solve-PIR-sensor-problems--delay-output.

A PIR sensor has 3 issues:
1. PIR doesn't work properly when starts.
2. PIR output value is always 1.
3. It some times doesn't read motions.

Now those are three Common and Unavoidable problems of a PIR sensor. So what would we do?
We need a solution to the problems so that you can use PIR in your project efficiently, also I've added a code below on how to solve that problem.

As I have mentioned earlier those are Common and Unavoidable, 
keep 3 issues in mind:

After powering - 
1. PIR sensor needs 1 minute to function
   For that 1 minute the OUTPUT is always HIGH.
2. When a motion is detected it'll take 5 to 7 seconds to detect motion again.
